Maximum drop proportions to retain correlation of 0.6 in at least 95% of the samples:

betweenness: 0.75 (CS-coefficient is highest level tested)
  - For more accuracy, run bootnet(..., caseMin = 0.672, caseMax = 1) 

closeness: 0.75 (CS-coefficient is highest level tested)
  - For more accuracy, run bootnet(..., caseMin = 0.672, caseMax = 1) 

strength: 0.75 (CS-coefficient is highest level tested)
  - For more accuracy, run bootnet(..., caseMin = 0.672, caseMax = 1) 

Accuracy can also be increased by increasing both 'nBoots' and 'caseN'.=== Correlation Stability Analysis ===
